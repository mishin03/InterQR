### *The application screen is a list of doors that can be unlocked by clicking on the cell. An API call is simulated. The goal was to work with SnapKit.*

## Installation

#### CocoaPods
You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `Framework` by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'InterQR' do
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for InterQR
pod 'SnapKit' 
```

To get the full benefits import `SnapKit` wherever you import UIKit

``` swift
import UIKit
import SnapKit
```
